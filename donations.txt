As you know, most of the software I release is free, and will always be free.
Keep in mind that this donation isn't for me to profit, it's to allow me
to continue developing free software and to keep boaddrink.com for you, the
user. Please remember that this software is free for you to download and use
but that doesn't mean it's not worth anything. You can donate any amount of
money you wish... from $1 to $1,000,000. While a million dollars would be
nice don't be pressured, any amount helps, even one dollar.
